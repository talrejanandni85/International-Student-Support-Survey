# International Student Survey Project ðŸ“Š

**Overview**  
This repository showcases a randomized survey experiment that explored how different framingsâ€”**moral**, **economic**, and **neutral**â€”influence U.S. citizensâ€™ support for international student initiatives. Participants were randomly assigned to read one of three articles and then asked about their policy preferences. This project was designed and executed as part of a group research assignment in Fall 2023.

## ðŸ§ª Study Design

Participants were assigned to one of three experimental groups:

| Group     | Stimulus Type         | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Moral**     | `moral_article.png`    | Framed international students as a moral responsibility and global community builders |
| **Economic**  | `economic_article.png` | Framed students as economic contributors and innovation drivers |
| **Control**   | `control_group_article.png` | A neutral university article unrelated to immigration or education policy |

They were then surveyed about their level of support for policies involving international students.
